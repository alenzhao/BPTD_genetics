This contains the joint tensor modeling for genetics and gene expression.

Various Bayesian priors will be added on later development.

**simulator.py** and **sampler.py**: simulate and sample real data

**simulator1.py** and **sampler1.py**: simulate and sample a symmetric tensor

**simulator2.py** and **sampler2.py**: simulate and sample one tensor

**simulator3.py** and **sampler3.py**: simulate and sample a matrix
